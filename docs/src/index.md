In [this YouTube
video](https://youtu.be/b5nElEbbnfU?si=IrswVLoaAn2xw6yt) Matt Parker
asks for a program to help design and solve jigsaw puzzles.

The idea is to produce a set of jigsaw puzzle pieces where the pieces
can be assembled in more than one way, and, ideally, in exactly two
ways.

This is an attempt at that.
